<h2>Idea</h2>

I wanted to create a simple and pleasant to use application that will help in the implementation of everyday tasks. 
Important for me during this project was the use of the Realm framework for data storage.


<h2>Technology</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SwiftUI</li>
  <li>Realm</li>
  <li>MVVM</li>
  <li>Animations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Presentation</h2>

<h4>ðŸš€Intro</h4>
<img src="https://github.com/bashubb/Simple_ToDO/blob/main/TODO%20Intro.gif" width ="50%"/>
When App is starting there is an animated Screen and if user hasn't added any task, there would be an information about it with link to addView.

<h4>ðŸª„Row animations</h4>

In the main view of application tasks are displayed in the list. Rows are custom animated - on tap task changes its state to 'completed' and goes on the bottom on the list. Swipe actions are also available.

<h4>ðŸª›Editing</h4>

If editing is needed. Just swipe the task to the left, tap on yellow button and simply change name of the task in the textfield.

<h4>ðŸ“©Sharing</h4>
